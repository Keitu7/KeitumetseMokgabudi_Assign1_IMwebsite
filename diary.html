                 My experience setting up Git – As a newly introduced user to the program, feelings of unfamiliarity caused slight hesitation in getting started.
                 However, with the assistance from a few beginner tutorials, I am slightly more comfortable with the basic program concepts and features - 
                 I’ve learned that Git is a version system control that lets one manage one’s code/data and essentially allows for the sharing, collaboration, and backup of projects/data.

                Reflection on the readings – From ‘The library of Babel’1998 my overall taking, through thorough reading, was that the piece covered themes of the infinite, paradox, and self-reference reasoning to the author himself. 
                Explorations/ uses of metaphors and the paradox of comparing the universe to the library – the author speaks of the futility of humans wanting to find and know all the knowledge there is to know 
                (that is in the books, in the library, in the universe) when there is, in fact too much for on to comprehend – an infinite amount of knowledge. 
                One cannot know all, as the knowledge contained in the universe is infinite. 
                And so, the paradoxical theme of the piece is in the library as all the books in a library do have a total (finite, countable) number. 
                I’d like to think that in contradiction to the author’s universe (the library’s books), it may be said that the internet is able to provide an ‘infinite’ amount of information. 
                My gathering from the second reading, ‘As we may think’ 1945, was that the piece presented ideas of the development and advancement in technology, machinery, inventions, etc. 
                Together the pieces bring ideas of how the advancement (and futuristic improvements) of technologies and the internet may produce further improved ways of accessing knowledge 
                across the world and produce an even greater /infinite amount of information – with the help of the internet being usable/accessible around the world.

                My goals for this course – are to learn and comprehend with full understanding and confidence, the taught concepts within the course - And be able to apply the theoretical and practical coursework successfully. 
                I aim to learn and improve my programming skills and learn about the necessary skills/ elements required to create successful (good) UI and UX - 
                perhaps reaching extensions of captivating the user, simply through good (great) web design.

                My experience starting with HTML – as HTML is a newly introduced markup language to me my initial feelings towards getting started were a great sense of anxiousness, but a frisson of excitement once I got started. 
                Learning the elementary tags that make the ‘bone’ structure of a website created using HTML, the semantics and functions of each tag, and how they can be used in a variety of ways was interesting. 
                The thoroughly enlightening lectures provided me with a hopeful understanding of the language thus far, so my experience with HTML left me feeling somewhat confident in my understanding.

                Reflection on Internet History was an interesting, thought-provoking section to learn about and thoroughly explore. 
                The lecture taught us about the historic timeline of the World Web and the web/browser war. 
                The timeline entailed details of the first browser launches, blogs, and various websites – it was interesting to learn how the internet/programs have changed, developed, and improved throughout their existence. 
                It was also interesting to learn about the Web Wars, how the very first browser wars came about, and who won and why…

                Reflection on the readings and how they tie in with my learning of HTML – the two articles have enlightened me on the importance of semantic markup, and how and why it matters – 
                for optimal accessibility, especially for screen reader users - Lawson, Bruce. “How A Screen Reader User Accesses The Web: A Smashing Video”. 
                I learned how, although the visual appeal of a webpage may be important in appealing to users, it is equally important that the tag functions of HTML are detailed in ways that serve equal intake from the webpage for screen reader users. 
                I also took away, the uses and differences of using the section and article elements, the lesson/moral of using “loads of h1s” but instead using h1; h2; h3; etc. in an orderly hierarchy. 
                And finally, the recommended use of section; main; header; footer and nav is very useful for screen reader users and those without assistive technology – Lawson, Bruce. “Why You Should Choose HTML5.”.

                Thoughts on the different perspectives of the course material presented by the supplementary material (past lectures) – 
                the supplementary course material (the recordings) have helped emphasize my understanding of the course, providing time for clearer absorption of the work from different perspectives. 
                From the interaction with the www supplementary lecture, what I gathered was that the basic definition/s of interaction would be something responsive; which does not respond in a completely random manner but rather (as an output) 
                responses according to the requested input; it requires non-trivial effort; which then modifies the shape of the text (Interaction with the www). 
                In explaining what interaction is and how it works, the lectures help to put into perspective and the understanding of how crucial it is to ensure the webpages we create, 
                serve users with the functional and correct output that they expect when interacting with the page/s. We also, get to understand why the interaction and its relation to UI are essential, because we are in the manipulation business – 
                of controlling our users when they are interacting with the work, navigating their actions, and creating and subverting meaning (Raheel, Interaction with the www, 2021).

                Reflection on the reading and lecture and how they tie into your understanding of UI and UX – I’ve come to understand the relationship between interactivity and UI as - 
                UI may be used to communicate how the user can request, but most importantly receive feedback/ response from a system e.g., on the www. 
                In Convention and Context, 1983, Mailloux defines what conventions refer to and covers the three kinds of shared practices (conventions). 
                The reading mentions these shared practices as three main kinds: traditional conventions that recognize past regularities in action, prescriptive shared practices that regulate future action, 
                and those that are constitutive conventions that determine present meaning (Mailoux, Convention, and Context 1983). And from drawing on the lectures, I’ve come to learn that together with interactivity (using conventional UI/UX), 
                applying those “shared practices” of web design, helps provide familiar, expected outcomes/responses for the user.

                Your experience continuing the development of your website – this process has been rather slow, as starting to project after the wireframe stage (and other ideas for the website) has been tricky. 
                However, after further practice and research, I believe that I will work towards achieving my envisioned idea with time. After learning CSS this week and understanding how it works together with HTML, 
                and the semantics involved, I somewhat have an idea of how to progress on my website hereon forth.

                Your experience continuing the development of your website – after learning about the basic principles of User Interface design, 
                I’ve come to understand how these principles/elements can be used to achieve more UI-friendly features and used to create “as streamlined an experience as possible” – 
                allowing users easier and simpler access to my website features. I did have new ideas/features that I fixed and iterated on, for instance, making use of commonly used/already established “icons that trigger pre-existing memory” 
                (UXPin, 2020; 4) instead of creating new icons (although creative) that require recalling instead of recognition.
            </p>
            <p class="week4para2">
                How do your wireframes hold up against the readings and lectures on UI? - based on what I gathered from the readings/lectures, my wireframe/s did need modification in editing certain features for rather simpler designs, 
                features that communicated clear page navigation, and presented a clear layout flow of the website. 
                Allowing for an easier and more simplistic styled layout of the website/pages, implementing and using user-friendly UI design features and principles. 
                What revisions can you already see that you will need? – Commonly used icons and already established, recognizable UI designs/features would prove for better, more improved revisions of the website that I will opt for. 
                After several iterations of the website’s wireframe design (as mentioned above), I did change the homepage layout/s slightly to provide the user with simpler, more familiar useful information/features.

            <p class="week4para3">
                How does the UI relate to how we defined interactivity last week? – interactivity refers to the responsiveness of a system, where the response is not in a random manner 
                but rather as an output that delivers/responds per the requested input. And UI being able to communicate how and where the user can request and receive feedback, it stands between the user and the system. 
                In turn, UI relates to interactivity as the interface represents interaction, it enables and embodies interaction. 
                As users interact with the system to receive a source of response (output), UI represents how users can interact with the system, but also communicates/feedback on the requested output.

                Reflection on this week’s readings – The readings this week mentioned topics concerning human interaction with machines, user interface and design which were interesting to explore. 
                Gibson’s reading speaks of alternative interfaces, computer input systems that allow “users to connect to the digital environment without” (Gibson, 2004) the conventional keyboard/mouse interfaces of computers. 
                In this, Gibson mentions Stelarc who has been actively involved in creating devices to bridge the gap between humans and machines – this had me contemplating on and questioning how 
                good/bad a fact the technological advancement of the human-machine interface like Stelarc’s Third Hand is…

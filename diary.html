                 My experience setting up Git – As a newly introduced user to the program, feelings of unfamiliarity caused slight hesitation in getting started.
                 However, with the assistance from a few beginner tutorials, I am slightly more comfortable with the basic program concepts and features - 
                 I’ve learned that Git is a version system control that lets one manage one’s code/data and essentially allows for the sharing, collaboration, and backup of projects/data.

                Reflection on the readings – From ‘The library of Babel’1998 my overall taking, through thorough reading, was that the piece covered themes of the infinite, paradox, and self-reference reasoning to the author himself. 
                Explorations/ uses of metaphors and the paradox of comparing the universe to the library – the author speaks of the futility of humans wanting to find and know all the knowledge there is to know 
                (that is in the books, in the library, in the universe) when there is, in fact too much for on to comprehend – an infinite amount of knowledge. 
                One cannot know all, as the knowledge contained in the universe is infinite. 
                And so, the paradoxical theme of the piece is in the library as all the books in a library do have a total (finite, countable) number. 
                I’d like to think that in contradiction to the author’s universe (the library’s books), it may be said that the internet is able to provide an ‘infinite’ amount of information. 
                My gathering from the second reading, ‘As we may think’ 1945, was that the piece presented ideas of the development and advancement in technology, machinery, inventions, etc. 
                Together the pieces bring ideas of how the advancement (and futuristic improvements) of technologies and the internet may produce further improved ways of accessing knowledge 
                across the world and produce an even greater /infinite amount of information – with the help of the internet being usable/accessible around the world.

                My goals for this course – are to learn and comprehend with full understanding and confidence, the taught concepts within the course - And be able to apply the theoretical and practical coursework successfully. 
                I aim to learn and improve my programming skills and learn about the necessary skills/ elements required to create successful (good) UI and UX - 
                perhaps reaching extensions of captivating the user, simply through good (great) web design.

                My experience starting with HTML – as HTML is a newly introduced markup language to me my initial feelings towards getting started were a great sense of anxiousness, but a frisson of excitement once I got started. 
                Learning the elementary tags that make the ‘bone’ structure of a website created using HTML, the semantics and functions of each tag, and how they can be used in a variety of ways was interesting. 
                The thoroughly enlightening lectures provided me with a hopeful understanding of the language thus far, so my experience with HTML left me feeling somewhat confident in my understanding.

                Reflection on Internet History was an interesting, thought-provoking section to learn about and thoroughly explore. 
                The lecture taught us about the historic timeline of the World Web and the web/browser war. 
                The timeline entailed details of the first browser launches, blogs, and various websites – it was interesting to learn how the internet/programs have changed, developed, and improved throughout their existence. 
                It was also interesting to learn about the Web Wars, how the very first browser wars came about, and who won and why…

            <p class="week2para3">
                Reflection on the readings and how they tie in with my learning of HTML – the two articles have enlightened me on the importance of semantic markup, and how and why it matters – 
                for optimal accessibility, especially for screen reader users - Lawson, Bruce. “How A Screen Reader User Accesses The Web: A Smashing Video”. 
                I learned how, although the visual appeal of a webpage may be important in appealing to users, it is equally important that the tag functions of HTML are detailed in ways that serve equal intake from the webpage for screen reader users. 
                I also took away, the uses and differences of using the section and article elements, the lesson/moral of using “loads of h1s” but instead using h1; h2; h3; etc. in an orderly hierarchy. 
                And finally, the recommended use of section; main; header; footer and nav is very useful for screen reader users and those without assistive technology – Lawson, Bruce. “Why You Should Choose HTML5.”.

                Thoughts on the different perspectives of the course material presented by the supplementary material (past lectures) – 
                the supplementary course material (the recordings) have helped emphasize my understanding of the course, providing time for clearer absorption of the work from different perspectives. 
                From the interaction with the www supplementary lecture, what I gathered was that the basic definition/s of interaction would be something responsive; which does not respond in a completely random manner but rather (as an output) 
                responses according to the requested input; it requires non-trivial effort; which then modifies the shape of the text (Interaction with the www). 
                In explaining what interaction is and how it works, the lectures help to put into perspective and the understanding of how crucial it is to ensure the webpages we create, 
                serve users with the functional and correct output that they expect when interacting with the page/s. We also, get to understand why the interaction and its relation to UI are essential, because we are in the manipulation business – 
                of controlling our users when they are interacting with the work, navigating their actions, and creating and subverting meaning (Raheel, Interaction with the www, 2021).

            <p class="week3para2">
                Reflection on the reading and lecture and how they tie into your understanding of UI and UX – I’ve come to understand the relationship between interactivity and UI as - 
                UI may be used to communicate how the user can request, but most importantly receive feedback/ response from a system e.g., on the www. 
                In Convention and Context, 1983, Mailloux defines what conventions refer to and covers the three kinds of shared practices (conventions). 
                The reading mentions these shared practices as three main kinds: traditional conventions that recognize past regularities in action, prescriptive shared practices that regulate future action, 
                and those that are constitutive conventions that determine present meaning (Mailoux, Convention, and Context 1983). And from drawing on the lectures, I’ve come to learn that together with interactivity (using conventional UI/UX), 
                applying those “shared practices” of web design, helps provide familiar, expected outcomes/responses for the user.

                Your experience continuing the development of your website – this process has been rather slow, as starting to project after the wireframe stage (and other ideas for the website) has been tricky. 
                However, after further practice and research, I believe that I will work towards achieving my envisioned idea with time. After learning CSS this week and understanding how it works together with HTML, 
                and the semantics involved, I somewhat have an idea of how to progress on my website hereon forth.

                Your experience continuing the development of your website – after learning about the basic principles of User Interface design, 
                I’ve come to understand how these principles/elements can be used to achieve more UI-friendly features and used to create “as streamlined an experience as possible” – 
                allowing users easier and simpler access to my website features. I did have new ideas/features that I fixed and iterated on, for instance, making use of commonly used/already established “icons that trigger pre-existing memory” 
                (UXPin, 2020; 4) instead of creating new icons (although creative) that require recalling instead of recognition.
            </p>
            <p class="week4para2">
                How do your wireframes hold up against the readings and lectures on UI? - based on what I gathered from the readings/lectures, my wireframe/s did need modification in editing certain features for rather simpler designs, 
                features that communicated clear page navigation, and presented a clear layout flow of the website. 
                Allowing for an easier and more simplistic styled layout of the website/pages, implementing and using user-friendly UI design features and principles. 
                What revisions can you already see that you will need? – Commonly used icons and already established, recognizable UI designs/features would prove for better, more improved revisions of the website that I will opt for. 
                After several iterations of the website’s wireframe design (as mentioned above), I did change the homepage layout/s slightly to provide the user with simpler, more familiar useful information/features. 
            </p>
            <p class="week4para3">
                How does the UI relate to how we defined interactivity last week? – interactivity refers to the responsiveness of a system, where the response is not in a random manner 
                but rather as an output that delivers/responds per the requested input. And UI being able to communicate how and where the user can request and receive feedback, it stands between the user and the system. 
                In turn, UI relates to interactivity as the interface represents interaction, it enables and embodies interaction. 
                As users interact with the system to receive a source of response (output), UI represents how users can interact with the system, but also communicates/feedback on the requested output.

            <p class="week4para4">
                Reflection on this week’s readings – The readings this week mentioned topics concerning human interaction with machines, user interface and design which were interesting to explore. 
                Gibson’s reading speaks of alternative interfaces, computer input systems that allow “users to connect to the digital environment without” (Gibson, 2004) the conventional keyboard/mouse interfaces of computers. 
                In this, Gibson mentions Stelarc who has been actively involved in creating devices to bridge the gap between humans and machines – this had me contemplating on and questioning how 
                good/bad a fact the technological advancement of the human-machine interface like Stelarc’s Third Hand is…

                The progress that I have made during these two weeks was a tad slower than the previous few weeks. 
                The slowdown in progress is due to my constant changing of the entire theme, design, and layout of the profile website,
                going back and forth on which design elements to use which would still preserve/hold on to the ideas of the profile that I initially envisioned –
                this was a tedious process. However, once I got the ‘for now’ (not final) wireframe done and coded, setting in a theme that I was content with, 
                would take even longer and that is why I decided to focus and give more attention to ensuring that the website adhered to the basic principles of user design.
                I looked at ways in which to implement designs that ‘made life easier for the user’: striving for clarity – using interfaces that avoided confusing (especially first-time) users,
                minimising steps and actions – keeping the primary action/purpose of each page front and centre, aiming for simplicity – limiting the use of too much wordy information, brightly 
                complicated colour schemes and rather sticking to providing useful information (UXPin, 2020). 
            </p>
            <p class="week5and6para2">
                I have gone back to visit a few websites for inspiration and guidance on the shared conventions of UI in profiles and portfolio designs and this helped me in brainstorming new ideas, 
                elements, and designs that I can implement at a later stage of my design/development journey. For future implementations and design reiterations, I would like to consider questions 
                concentrating on goal alignment: What do I want users to see and do when interacting with the interface? Who is my target audience, and what is the purpose of their being on my website?
                What type of content on my website is considered essential for/to the user? Additionally, I did also read over Hassenzahl and Tractinsky’s reading on User experience (2006). I gathered 
                some knowledge on the effects of HCI (Human Computer Interface) and UX – and learned of UX and its interest in taking a “human perspective” (Hassenzahl and Tractinsky, 2006; 93) and it 
                rather focusing on positive emotions of fun and joy (Hassenzahl and Tractinsky, 2006; 93).
                This made me think more deeply about the integration and effects of UX as I make further developments to my site…

                My experience continuing the development of my Website – the process of my website is a continuous roller coaster as I have constant new ideas and changes that I want to implement e.g., changing the overall theme and colour scheme.  
                The main pages have been set (the Home page, About, and Contact), and although I am content with these pages, I feel the Home page needs more attention and work which I would like to work on at a later stage…I have made some developments to the design and style section, 
                which essentially demonstrate and communicate the original and final wireframe designs; the intended design layouts, goals, and other website design intentions/goals e.g., the UX and UI design intentions. Anyhow, the development and design process for this website is a constant iterative and ongoing process. 
            </p>
            <p class="week7para2">
                Going through the process of the outlined Ethics of UX Practice:
                Speaking to each step – referring to the IxD Process Mashup lecture slides and each step of the process, 
                there are the Goal alignment, Information structure, User Flow Screens, Interface Elements, and Design and Implementation steps. 
                So far, I have worked on the Design section step of the process, which entails me having completed the Wireframe designs and the different style guide ideas. 
                I have also completed the goal alignment statement and provided information on the content mapping and structure of the site’s overall layout design. I have provided illustrations of the 
                User Flow Screens, Behaviours, and Decision functions that would work in the future development of the site. I do, however, must still work on the implementation of the Interface Elements of the site as this 
                section/process has required me to do more research into how I would like the interface interface elements of my site to function – more time must still be dedicated to step/section.
            </p>
            <p class="week7para3">
                Explaining your Decision-making process – for the most part, the only required decision-making needed was in the design, content mapping, and information structure implementations into the website. 
                In some sections the designs that I initially had, turned out to not appear as I had envisioned them to be or communicate what I wanted them to. 
                Therefore, a lot of decision-making had to be done in terms of deciding which design and style elements and interface elements would work better.
            </p>
            <p class="week7para4">
                Reflect on this week’s reading - in the reading, Hassenzahl and Tractinsky talk about UX and the relationship and interaction between computers and humans (HCI). 
                They go on to mention how UX research is concerned with the affective consequences of UX on humans rather than with technology (Hassenzahl and Tractinsky, 2006; 93).  
                What particularly caught my interest was the fact that UX “takes a ‘human’ perspective” (Hassenzahl and Tractinsky, 2006; 93). It’s fascinating how UX/UX research can 
                be used to evoke/create positive emotional outcomes such as joy, and fun, as well as have an objective to prevent feelings of dissatisfaction and frustration.

                Reflect on the website you have submitted for Assignment 1 – what I would do differently is the overall theme and font style of the site and the layout design of certain pages of the site. 
                I would like to redesign my Home page, does indeed feel out of place with what a Home page would normally consist of. I will redesign the ‘my work’ page and add perhaps larger grid boxes for each 
                piece of my work that I plan to showcase (in assignment 3). I will also design the contacts page by using a larger font to make what is important about the page stand out more, to make it feel less boring or superfluous –
                use colours and elements that communicate a cut-and-clear Contact page. Where I struggled was with the site’s overall theme and colour scheme. This was an ongoing back-and-forth process that took a rather long time, ultimately, 
                I ended up leaving the website theme and colour schemes as they were due to limited time. It was astounding how long it took to achieve the satisfactory font and colour scheme that I had initially envisioned – an elegant, simple two-four-toned 
                colour scheme with the use of a sophisticated font that communicated calmness, a standard of tastefulness visual design, and classy aesthetic. This all still needs a lot of work. What went right?... I managed to create the bare minimum of a submittable website! 
                I did like the design layout and style of the diary – The dev blogs page. The About page design layout also was surprisingly good as this was somewhat what I had initially envisioned, and I managed to communicate to the user the important page contents with a clear and simple interface. 
                The design and style page presented good illustrations of the design plans and intention.

            <p class="week8para2">
                Reflect on how you think the Two Readings relate – in the Graham et al reading, the concept of information geographies is explored, and the authors provide a framework for understanding how information is created, shaped, and distributed across the world in the digital age. 
                The authors state how information is unevenly distributed and not universally accessible – I would like to understand that ‘accessible’ this time may refer to both people lacking the technological devices to access the information/ people being also being able to understand that information. 
                This leads to how the dominating producers of information (in the digital dimension of information) may have more power to give and take information that is more concerning to them e.g., feed the world topics that are more concerned about the Global North. Concerning the spread of information 
                in the digital dimension, the topic of digital colonialism would be interesting to explore…The reading also goes on to propose a framework of three dimensions of information geographies; Physical, digital, and cognitive. Thereafter, the authors explore the emphasis on the need to study both the 
                mutable and immutable aspects of information geographies. Mutable refers to the constantly changing nature of information flows, policies, and platforms, while immutable refers to the representation of the enduring spatial and social inequalities that shape the accessibility and distribution of information. 
            </p>

                In the text by Ballatore, Graham, and Sen, the authors argue the crucial role that searches engines play in shaping the information available/accessible to especially local users. 
                The paper emphasizes the implications of the emergence of digital hegemonies for information access; how the localised results from these search engines create and reinforce the 
                imbalance of power and limited diverse information sources. Reflect on how you think the Two Readings impact your thinking about web dev as a South African – Although these two 
                readings do not directly speak on web development, I did gather the cruciality of understanding information geography and the limited accessibility to a variety and diverse amount of 
                information due to localised results from search engines. In terms of web development, the readings gave me a better understanding of how the digital environment functions concerning the spread of information – 
                I think perhaps bringing an awareness/attention to how the digital content we create may influence/ affect the overall search engines results and information spread, the South African digital environment/community 
                could a start thinking of ways to address these issues.

            Continuing the development of the website – I’ve been trying and testing out where I can start making use of this week’s learned technical concepts – I have looked at implementing the measurement units and flexbox elements. 
            The different measurement units have been a little tricky to implement especially at a stage where I am still learning to make use of them correctly. For the flexbox, I may use the element when working on creating the different screen 
            sizes and how the elements of the site will behave on the different screen sizes – responsive design. 
            I make use of flexbox and div boxes on the page where I show my work. I am also still looking at sections where I can make use of JavaScript to simplify certain coding elements/functions.

            A close reading on Magenya – 2020 – Making a Feminist Internet in Africa Why the internet needs African Feminists and Feminisms – In her reading, Sheena talks about and explores the importance of making an African feminist Internet, 
            why the Internet needs African Feminists and Feminisms. 
           </p>
           <p class="week9para3">
            She argues that the problem lies in presenting the internet as a solution to what is a social problem, the internet as a platform that imagines that it provides equal access to all. 
            Sheena states that more African feminists are needed to counter the belief that somehow technology can be used to create equality, power balances, and information accessibility. When in fact, 
            the case is that the Internet is not a neutral or gender-blind space, but rather reflects existing gender inequalities and power imbalances. By having more African females involved on the internet, 
            their provided unique experiences can contribute valuable insights and create a more inclusive internet/ internet environment.

           <p class="week9para4">
            An emphasis on the need for African feminists to participate in engaging in digital spaces to counter the Western-centric notions of feminism that may not echo the contexts of Africa should well be a topic for deeper exploration. 
            For African feminists to find their voices in the digital spaces and challenge the norms. The author then goes on to discuss the need for collaboration amongst African feminists to strengthen our impact of advocating meaningful 
            changes in the social activities, governance, and policies of the internet.

        Continuing the development of the process – What changes have you made to incorporate JavaScript? 
        So far, I have only thought of using JavaScript for the nav bar interface, how to incorporate it. 
        I plan to use a rather simplified code that will provide a function for the navigation bar and incorporate it so that one function can be used to provide a consistent nav bar design and function throughout the entire website (instead of making only HTML and CSS nav bar for each page like for Assignment 1). I am also looking into adding JavaScript to the Dev blog page – the plan would be to add buttons for each blog week onto the right side of the page, then with each click, the corresponding blog post would appear on the left side of the page. 
        I still need to ask for assistance with this function.

           <p class="week10para2">
        How does this help you streamline your interaction design? In terms of code, this implementation may help simplify my code and create a readable 
        code that avoids the repetition of code that could have been avoided in Assignment 1. 
        In terms of the interaction design, it will help navigate through the several weeks of blog posts more easily and create a smoother interface interaction with the page.

        A reflection on the readings – the reading ‘The Road to Technocolonialism’ by Giorgos Verdi explores the topic of AI and how the power of its influence gives countries 
        like the US and China political influence and streams of data (Verdi, 2020).  This text highlights the transformative power that AI has in the economic and military domain, 
        and how the integration of AI into economies will drive global productivity and growth rates. We come to understand the power and growing political influence that AI gives China 
        and the United States as the top leaders in AI development. This gets me thinking about the extent of China and the US’s dominance and the geopolitical consequences of their growing 
        power/influences, particularly their influence on developing countries - how this influential power topic opens to exploring the concept of technolcolinialism.

           Continuing the development process – How your CSS relates to the HTML and JS – I find my CSS to be carrying the most informative and interactive interface of the website. 
           This may be due that I still need to work on implementing more JavaScript in a way that makes the coding for HTML and CSS simplified. For instance, regarding the nav bars, 
           as mentioned previously, I do feel the repetition function of making a consistent nav bar for each page could be simplified with a function using JavaScript. 
           My CSS I would like to think carries/ is the interactive interface of the site, helping to communicate the UI and perhaps even the UX.

            The benefits and challenges of responsive design – The challenges in responsive design were in the measurement units. 
            After having used one form of a unit of measurement, when you begin experimenting and challenging the other units on your elements and interface, 
            and see your work move in all directions on the screen, the thought o having to do this throughout the entire site did feel rather daunting. 
            So, this is something I still need to work on, on my site to make the site a more user-friendly responsive design.

            Thinking about how code matters in digital colonialism, are there any things that you should be aware of in your code? – 
            As of now, I would think that awareness of the syntax of any coding language is crucial, and adhering to conventions of code may be important, 
            especially as a beginner in the world of web design and coding.

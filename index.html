                Hi there! My name is Keitumetse Mercedes M. You can call me Keitu. I am a student web designer, a Web developer in the making. 
                As a current student in the web design field, although my experience is still new, the knowledge I’ve gained this far has evoked passion, a sense of creativity, and inspiration – 
                thus giving me an awareness of the infamous channels of creativity and unlimited possibilities open in web designing. 
                And this opportunity of creation for me begins here with my profile webpages. 
            </p>

            <h5 class="heading2">The journey to today and my work</h5>
            <img class="journey_image" src="/images/pexels-ashley-fontana-705785.jpg" alt="This is an image of a road surrounded by tress.">
            <p class="para2"> 
                My journey in web design as a student has been engrossing. That is, also leaving me intrigued by the extent to which I can push my creativity – 
                I look forward to exploring more of what is possible in the world of web development and design. 
                In the journey of building my first portfolio website, I’ve allowed myself to explore the possible extent to which I could show my imagined ideas – honestly, I envisioned it all differently. 
                But it’s an ongoing journey, so I‘ll be exploring a lot more.

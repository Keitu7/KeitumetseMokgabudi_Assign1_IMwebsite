                 When referring to designing an interface within this context of web designing, we talk about designing a way to represent the interactions (their visuals), “that take place within our system” (Goldberg) – 
                 designing how our content will be represented. So then, what are the interactions within the system? Interaction, the interactivity would be the responsiveness of the system, the responsiveness not being 
                 randomly but rather outputting/responding as per requested input. But to understand the interaction possible within the system, it must be visually represented, this is where understanding UI comes in, as 
                 well as UX…This essay will present a detailed analysis of and discuss the UI and UX elements and principles of a South African Website of my choice - this website of choice will be the South African Chicken Licken restaurant chain website. 
                 Thereafter, this essay will then deliberate on the ethics of the interaction design of the chosen and discussed website. Moreover, to substantiate and provide further evidence of research on my discussion, the essay will draw on readings 
                 by Hassenzahl and Tractinsky on User Experience, 
                 Don’t Make Me Think by Steve King, Smashing UX Design: Foundations for Designing Online User Experiences by authors Jesmond Allen and James Chudley, and a blog from Kelsey Campbell-Bones on Dark UI Best Practices and Examples.
                  <span class="readMoreText">
                     
                        Interface in web design may be an essential part of web designing in that the Interface of a website would be what gives the user the ‘first impression’ of the site, and there are several User Interface 
                        design principles that help mark down ways to create a product that gives on the first impression. Designing an interface that uses conventional visual design elements and interaction design principles 
                        that do not confuse the user or ‘make them think’ is one of the most essential principles of UI design – using conventional elements such as common images and icons in context helps users easily recognise 
                        and identify functionality (UXPin, 2020). The user interface element is what the user directly interacts with in order to get a response from the system, therefore the use of a simple interface design with 
                        an adequate amount of information on the first load should be at a minimum – striving to reduce cognitive load for users. The UI design must also feedback on what its UI elements communicate it should do/give 
                        feedback to their corresponding interfaced interaction - the UI elements must respond to what it represents on its interface. 
                        This brings us to the discussion of understanding how Chicken Licken’s website UI design makes good use of UI principles. 
                     
                    
                        On first notice, the Chicken Licken website has made use of a Dark, black background theme to contrast the restaurant’s colour scheme theme. The site’s use of a black and a lighter shade of grey hue background 
                        carried throughout most of the several menu pages gives an eye-resting ‘white’ space against the main brighter colours of the theme. Although these brighter colours are not harsh bright tones that could cause strain on the eye 
                        with the black-grey background in contrast (Campbell-Bones, 2022). Somehow, the use of the brighter theme colours is balanced well with sufficient resting ‘white’ space for the eye – 
                        this was successfully managed in that the pure black background throughout these pages was made less dim/ deep strong with a slightly lighter shade of black, grey countertop image is used to give the entire background an illusioned ‘countertop’ mix background. 
                        Using black and grey as the background colour helps make the menu images and texts stand out and attract the eye to focus on the actual menu and anything of brighter colour and importance becomes more easily readable. Another UI element to note is in making the site’s interface beautiful, 
                        the colour scheme of black, grey, white, orange, and yellow give subtle use of colour and communicate the restaurant’s desired theme. The use of white text in contrast to the grey-black creates more readability on the page’s texts and the interface design of the black space hue allows the 
                        eye to rest on a subtly dark hue. In terms of interaction and the UI, the interaction when hovering over each menu meal is communicated with each meal container/box motioning forward with an orange (bordered radius) border UI, making that specific meal box slightly larger and bolder against the black background. 
                        This demonstrates useful design in that these elements communicate to the user how and what interface section/part of the page is interactable, providing useful feedback. 
                        Adhering to convention – the site maintains consistent conventions of web design, such as the navigation bar remaining in the same space throughout each page as the user would expect - The website has used interactivity together with conventional UI practice to provide familiar, expected responses 
                        (outputs) for the user and demonstrating shared prescriptive practices in the UI design (Mailloux, 1983). 
                    
                    
                        The UX design of this website would entail what makes the interfaces of the site useful, and what elements or functions help the user accomplish goals within using the website. 
                        UX is the overall feel of the experience received within using the product, the UX design aims to provide the primary goal of a positive interaction experience with the product/ website. Within experiencing this case study of the Chicken Licken website, 
                        what meaningful experiences does this website give or provide for the user? When interacting with this product, the process/journey that the system’s interactivity provides is of journeying through a world of unusual, unbelievable, experiences and fantastical 
                        activities/journeys where this theme is introduced to the viewer in the introductory three-image slide show (on the website) - The user is introduced to this system’s world/product through the front images and large font slogan on the website’s Homepage. 
                        Viewers see images of activities that wouldn’t usually occur in everyday life, this could be representing how having a meal from this restaurant could take you to places where unbelievable things happen. The use of these particular images where unusual things a 
                        happening, together with the slogan “unbelievable but true”, the viewer is already brought into and experiencing Chicken Licken’s world of unbelievable things. 
                     
                     
                        The first interaction that the user experiences or interacts with within the first three clicks are through the three-image slide show on the Homepage – by designing a three-image slide show within the early stages of interaction with the system, 
                        cognitive load is reduced in users are not made to think (UXPin, 2020). The slideshow can automatically slide to the next image without the user having to interact with it – this shows users how to interact with the image slide show system without 
                        making users think. On stating in his book ‘Don’t Make Me Think’, author Steve Krug points out how people are good at and generally go on taking the first solution available that solves their problem, and so design should advantage of this (Krung, 2000). 
                        On taking advantage of this, Chicken Licken’s website simply gives the user what they came here for, the answer to their problem – the menu. 
                        The website directly gives the user the interaction to the next part of the page with the bold-headed title and navigational arrow “View our Menu”. 
                        In this way, the Homepage introduces the theme through reduced cognitive load, then offers the Menu - taking advantage by offering the “first available solution” (Krung, 2000). 
                        Within the first three clicks (the 3-click-rule), the user can lead themselves and toggle to three different pages with information on the menu, menu options extended, delivery, and contact details or all within the navigation bar. 
                        The use of Laws that affect UX within this system would be Hick’s Law – the time taken to make a decision increase with the number of complex choices available. Here, the Chicken Licken website makes use of categorising its menu into meal types that 
                        the user’s search experience for their preferred meal – decreasing user frustration and experience in indecisiveness. Lastly, one basic principle of design in the system’s design is the use of balance and alignment elements. 
                        The menu meals layout is of good alignment where each meal box is of equal border size, design, and line up in row composition. 
                        The overall primary goal is to give a positive interaction experience by the time the user is led to the end of the site (final page). 
                     
                     
                        Deliberating on the ethics of the interaction design: speaking on Araz’s three mentioned essential aspects of User Experience, Subjectivity, Contributing Agents, and Singular and Accumulated experiences can be discussed concerning this website analysis. 
                        Subjectivity speaks to how UX occurs not within the object (in this case the website) itself, but rather, in the user’s experiences that occur because of interacting with the website. The user could experience a satisfactory experience and emotions in that 
                        they found simple interactional directions to the menu directly on the Homepage, and quickly that is. The second aspect is the Contributing Agents, for UX to take place the service (website) helps give the user an experience – for this website, the user’s 
                        experience would be the motivation and need for using the service, hunger. And the context is the situation in which the interaction occurs – time and location may be lunchtime and location being anywhere but in the restaurant. 
                        The third aspect is the Singular and accumulated experience – the experiences felt through interaction with not only the object but with other interactions that occur concerning any interaction with the object (website) such as speaking to the delivery consultant or receiving the delivery order. 
                     
                     
                        The three types of UX Ethics that can be deliberate on and considered are first, the Existential Values – going beyond the product offered, am I in agreement with the company’s values, the mission and design intent of their products? Concerning the UX design experienced through Chicken Licken’s website, the mission is to promote their ‘unbelievable but true’ product/s experience and design intent being how they present their offered products – 
                        but are these products delivered and received (by the user) as advertised? Second, the Benevolent Intent – are the user’s needs (need of information concerning how to satisfy their hunger per their preference) placed above all while approaching product development? The third UX Ethic to consider would be Misdirected intent – being aware as designers, of the competing needs. 
                        In this case, which products are displayed first or top of the list as they would bring in more money for the company, which meals from the overall menu, sell faster/ are more popular – competing needs? The specific display of only certain popular products and not the entire available menu (in the actual restaurant) may be misinforming the user based on where they purchase the Chicken Licken meals, online or in the actual restaurant (Goldberg).
                     
                    
                        To conclude, the overall interaction experience with the UI of the Chicken Licken website was of positivity as the web delivered the basic service that it was expected to – 
                        a simplified, good widget-aligned design of the available menu meals. 
                        The menu meals were categorised in a logical manner which lessened the user’s cognitive load in understanding the menu functionality and readability. 
                        The interface was simple, the user wanted the menu, it was presented on the homepage in bold font, the user wanted burgers, and an interactive burger menu was presented. 
                        Consistency was kept in that the navigation bar presented the same page name navigation throughout each different loaded page. 
                        E.g., the page name Delivery remained in the same position on the navigation bar throughout each page. The interactable UI interfaces enabled a flow in the User Experience journey, 
                        in that what was expected to be clickable and interactable was functional – the user was not left frustrated in the interaction process or journey when engaging with the system.
                        The pleasant experience was in that the user was introduced to a world of possible unbelievable food experiences, 
                        a simple (not overwhelming) UI layout design with an aesthetically pleasing visual interface design and colour scheme.

                    The Algorithmic Culture and AI Impacting the Internet.
                </P>
                <p class="essay2">
                    On the 30th of May 2023, CAIS (Center for AI Safety) released a statement concerning the impact and effects that artificial intelligence (AI) may have on global society. 
                    CAIS’s statement suggests and addresses the potential extinction caused by AI, and how similar larger-scale risks such as pandemics (for instance, the COVID-19 pandemic) and nuclear war. 
                    Essentially, CAIS is emphasizing the potential dangers that AI poses globally, particularly to those related to the risk of extinction, which are the ones that seek more attention. 
                    These dangers should be prioritized with the other societal-scale risks and threats that can have the potential significance to affect humanity, its lives, and its future. 
                    Proceeding onwards into this topic, this essay will be discussing the impact of algorithmic culture and AI on the Internet, using the theoretical framework of the Ethical Internet as a lens for this critical analysis. 
                    In doing so, the essay will explore and expound on the details that AI risk entails, what the statement on AI risk concerns, and its relevant impact on humanity. 
                    This essay seeks to learn and understand the answers to questions of how the CAIS defines AI risk, and what their thoughts are regarding it; thereafter, provide a personal analysis discussing the 
                    core subject of this piece – ‘Algorithmic Culture and AI on the Internet’. To provide substantiating points, the essay will mainly reference resources from readings by Abeba Birhane and 
                    Fred Cummins on ‘Algorithmic Injustices: Toward a Relational Ethics’ (2019), ‘The Internet as a moral space: the legacy of Roger Silverstone’ (2007) by Shani Orgad and 
                    ‘The Virtual sphere’ (2002) by Zizi Papacharissi. 
                    Let us begin by attempting to understand what the Algorithmic Culture and AI impacting the internet refers to. 
                </p>
                <p class="essay3">
                    To understand the concept and relation between algorithmic culture, and the internet, we can understand an algorithm to be the logical, mathematical, and sequential set of rules/ operations used to specify how a group of data behaves. 
                    In social media for instance, algorithms assist in maintaining order and ranking in search results, advertisements or content-recommendation assembles – for social content- recommendation algorithms, 
                    the content on media platforms like Netflix and Spotify, are the programmed decision-making operations that assemble and organise flows of content (Carah, 2017). 
                    Algorithms can be thought of/ used in a way that refers to complex machine learning processes rather than one specific formula providing stable, consistent feedback. 
                    Algorithms learn, they adjust and constantly learn, and remodel based on feedback – this is usually accomplished through the “generation of a training ‘model’ on a corpus of existing data” (Carah, 2017) 
                    which has been certified/verified either by the algorithm designers or data from past users practices, they are trained based in past activities/requests and pre-established judgments (from users activities) 
                    and then learn and adapt to make those judgments into functional interactions (Carah, 2017) – therefore algorithms are tuned and applied processes, instead of being constantly redesigned. So then, what is algorithmic culture? 
                    Algorithmic culture refers to the historical process where computational processes are used to store, collect and organise human culture, which is concerned with computational processes as the product used to order the work of culture. 
                </p>
                <p class="essay4">
                    Striphas notes, that the work of culture, be it the sorting/organising, classifying, and prioritizing of ideas, objects, people, and places have been delegated to computational systems and processes by humans – 
                    humans have been teaching/giving culture, which is the system of judgment and decision-making to computers. As cultural values, preferences, and tastes all the systems of judging ideas, objects, 
                    and practices judge performances as good or bad, etc. it is then that Striphas points out that by looking at what the algorithmic culture is and what it is about, that we realize that the built computational machines are 
                    what can be used to simulate the forms of judgment. Essentially in the piece ‘Algorithmic culture’ (2015), we understand algorithmic culture as the computational processes used to organise, categorise and classify the hierarchy of people, 
                    places and objects, ideas, as well as the habits of conduct and expression. Therefore, Stiphas emphasises the point of algorithmic culture involves both the machine’s learning capabilities to make decisions concerning culture, 
                    and humans learning how to address those machines (Striphas in Carah, 2017).
                </p>
                <p class="essay5">
                    Then, how does algorithmic culture relate to the internet and AI? Algorithmic culture is intertwined with the internet in that the internet is the platform that provides the infrastructure for the dissemination and implementation of algorithms. 
                    The internet enables and allows for the interaction, collection, storing, organising, and processing of vast data essential for training and teaching AI algorithms. AI machine learning algorithms are designed and trained to learn patterns and human-habitual choices, 
                    thus making predictions, recommendations, and decisional judgments based on data. This relation between AI and algorithmic culture is then used in recommendation systems, social media platforms, and so forth; essentially providing the sorting of human culture data - 
                    thus providing algorithmic recommendations services such as Netflix film and television popularity algorithms. 
                    The impact of the relationship between algorithmic culture and AI on the internet shall be explained once we understand the correlating relation between the ethical internet, the algorithmic culture, and AI.

                <p class="essay6">
                    The ethical internet as a theoretical framework refers to the concept of forwarding and promoting an online environment that upholds ethical principles and values. 
                    It entails a range of aspects to consider, such as the privacy and security of personal data, transparency, freedom of expression, and respect for the user’s rights. 
                    This framework (the ethical internet) emphasizes the cruciality of the responsible use of technology and the internet to ensure the fair treatment and rights protection of individual users and communities. 
                    By recognising the potential impact of digital technologies such as AI on society, the ethical internet aims to address the ethical challenges arising in the digital environment by bringing awareness to the 
                    influence that digital technologies have in shaping societies and users’ lives. The ethical internet as a framework aims with key aspects of privacy and personal data protection, to emphasise the protection of 
                    individual data by calling for transparent data collection practices, informed consent, and guarding against unauthorized access to personal information. In security and cybersecurity, by ensuring a secure internet environment, 
                    the ethical internet promotes security measures such as encryption, uncompromising cybersecurity practices, and secure communication protocol and procedures. 
                    And through transparency, the ethical internet encourages transparency in decision-making concerning algorithmic design, data sorting practices, and online platform policies. 
                    In the ethical internet acknowledging the power of digital technologies to shape individual lives, ethical principles, and practices can be used to strive for an internet that respects and considers its users and empowers users while mitigating potential harms. 
                    Therefore, the impact of algorithmic culture and AI on the internet may be a result of certain internet ethics not being practiced/met…

                    As mentioned earlier above, in May 2023, the CAIS (Centre for AI Safety) released a statement on AI Risk and its potential harms. 
                    This statement is concerned with the growing regulation and risks that the fast-moving technology poses/has posed to humanity, owing to existential fears that job markets could be significantly affected, 
                    causing health harm and increasing discrimination and impersonation (Abdul, 2023). While this signed document statement is not the first of its kind, this statement did show its potential impact given its wider range of 
                    signatories/ signatures and its core concern of the impacting effects of AI and its risks. This statement was thus signed by those working in the AI and technologies field, as them being concerned with the growing realization and recognition of the existing existential novel risks of AI – 
                    thus signed by more than 350 executives, scientists, researchers, academics, and two of three prominent researchers in the field. One of these concerns that may specifically raise fear in using AI may be the used type of A.I. system in so-called language models that might be used 
                    at a scale to spread propaganda or eliminate/ take over white-collar jobs. Some believe that A.I. could be used to create societal-scale disruptions, therefore, essentially the fear shared by numerous leaders in the AI field may very well be the risk and fear concerned with the 
                    furiously racing pace to build and growth of a technology without considering the regulated risks concerned.

                    So, after considering the risks concerned with the vast growing pace of AI, we, therefore, need to understand the overall relationship and impact of the Algorithmic culture and AI on the internet, as well as how the ethical internet is involved/concerned. 
                    Algorithmic culture and AI on the Internet are both concepts that interconnect in shaping the digital landscape environment and influence our online interactions and experiences. They relate in ways that Algorithmic culture refers to the 
                    pervasive influence of algorithms in shaping various aspects of human everyday life and culture, including online interactions and experiences – the classifying and hierarchizing of objects, ideas, people, practices, and performances. 
                    While algorithms use the information they are trained and taught regarding human culture to curate content, make recommendations and personalize information, algorithmic culture is concerned with transparency, accountability, bias, and the potential 
                    impact and social issues of algorithmic systems. Artificial Intelligence, particularly algorithm learning machines plays a role on the Internet in that these AI algorithms are employed in various recommending systems, language processing, and automated decision-making applications. 
                    As the AI algorithms learn patterns from collected data and make predictions and recommendations based on that information, in doing so, the development and deployment of AI on the internet do raise ethical considerations concerning fairness/equality, transparency, accountability, privacy, and bias. 
                    The ethical Internet focuses on and is concerned with fostering an ethically principled online environment that aims to protect user rights and mitigate potential harm. 
                    By encompassing considerations such as transparency, inclusivity, privacy, and security, the ethical Internet ensures an address to the ethical challenges associated with algorithmic culture and AI on the Internet.

                    Considering the impact of algorithmic culture and AI on the internet, there are various aspects concerning our lives and the digital landscape to consider: the algorithmic culture and AI algorithms enable personalised experiences on the internet using recommendation systems 
                    suggesting relevant content and users’ preferences. Algorithms play a crucial role in filtering and curating content on social media platforms and search engines, and in doing so, they prioritize, and present content based on relevance, user preferences, and popularity e.g., 
                    Netflix algorithms on film popularity. This content filtering and curation shapes the information users are exposed to, be it good or withholding certain information and only presenting one certain perspective. Algorithmic culture and AI on the internet also have economic 
                    implications in terms of job loss and substitution (Paul, 2023). Businesses leverage AI algorithms to optimise marketing campaigns, improve customer service and streamline operations to a ‘perfect’/ better standard than human labour. Essentially, this results in businesses 
                    opting for AI-powered tools to assist in data analysis and decision-making, resulting in enhanced business performance and competitiveness. 
                    This use of AI algorithms over human labour, although beneficial to business, does put into question the need for human-paid labour - what, therefore, does the future hold for human labour and their jobs?

                <p class="essay10">
                    In concluding the impact of algorithmic culture and AI on our online experiences and the Internet, we have come to understand that algorithmic culture describes the influence of algorithms in shaping those experiences based on human culture. 
                    And the ethical Internet emphasizes the need for responsible and ethical practices to confront and address the challenges posed by taught judgments from algorithmic culture and AI on the Internet. 
                    Together, they all form a framework for understanding the ethical recommendations and considerations in the online environment and digital realm.
